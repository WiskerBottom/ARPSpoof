# ARPSpoof
A (half functional) program to perform an ARP spoofing attack.

I worked on this program a while ago, but from what I remember it the victim will see the internet and can ping out while the machine running this script can intercept all their traffic. However it seems to have trouble with packet fragmentation so when trying to browse the internet on the victim it will break.
